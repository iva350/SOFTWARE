Uber-like System Simulation in Java This project is a simple simulation of an Uber-like system implemented in Java. It demonstrates basic Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism. The system includes classes for managing accounts, drivers, users, cars, and UberX vehicles.

Key Features Account Management: Base class for drivers and users with common attributes like name, document, email, and password.

Driver and User Classes: Inherit from the Account class and include methods to print their details.

Car and UberX Classes: Represent vehicles with attributes like license plate, driver, and passenger count. The UberX class extends the Car class to include brand and model details.

Main Class: Demonstrates the functionality by creating instances of cars, UberX vehicles, and users, and printing their details.
